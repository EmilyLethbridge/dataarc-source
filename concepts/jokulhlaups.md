## Jokulhlaups

###  Scope note: 

'Jokulhlaups' are glacial outburst floods, which may be related to subglacial volcanic activity. Volcanically induced jokulhlaups are created by the melting of overlying ice through an eruption. This eruption may or may not break through the surface of the overlying glacier. Many of Iceland's most active volcanoes are covered by glaciers and jokulhlaups are relatively frequent. The largest of these floods can have peak discharges greater than the flow of River Amazon. The 1918 eruption of Katla had a discharge of 300,000 cubic metres per second. Smaller floods can occur from flank eruptions, with thinner overlying ice. These floods are responsible for considerable localised environmental change, eroding canyons, removing soil, adding sediment to sandur plains and forming a major hazard to people, farmland and infrastructure. Tephrochronology can be used to date these deposits in Iceland.

### Examples: 

* Early 10th century CE eruption from Katla created a jökulhlaup which swamped farmland of Norse settlers to the south of Mýrdalsjökull and is recorded in Landnámabók.

* Early 10th century CE eruption from the western flanks of Eyjafjallajökull produced a volcanic ridge and jökulhlaup in a populated part of southern Iceland, but is not recorded in Landnámabók.

* The 1362 eruption of Öræfajökull (SE Iceland) produced a jökulhlaup that devastated nearby farmland resulting in the area being renamed "Öræfi", meaning wasteland.
