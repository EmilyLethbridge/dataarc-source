## Seal

###  Scope note:
Seals (Phocidae) are the most common sea mammals in the North Atlantic, with the migratory Harp seal (Pagophilius groenlandicus) currently estimated at 15-17 million individuals. Humans have hunted seals across the region since at least the Mesolithic, and seal hunting became a key element in the subsistence economy of the Norse Greenlanders and Native American hunters in Labrador. Seals in the Eastern North Atlantic (Norway, Denmark, British Isles, Ireland, Faroes, Iceland) are represented by the common or harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) and the larger and less common Grey seal (Halichoerus gryphus). Both form breeding colonies that are vulnerable to over-exploitation by hunters and in medieval and early modern times their exploitation was tightly regulated. Seal bones in these areas tend to be a trace element in archaeofauna (5% or less). In Greenland Norse settlers encountered resident common/harbor seal colonies in the SW, but also encountered the huge populations of migratory ice-riding Harp (Pagophilius groenlandicus) and Hooded (Cystophora cristata) seals. This revolutionized Norse marine hunting, and seal bones (mainly Harp) can make up 80% of Norse archaeofauna in Greenland. The Hooded seals were regularly taken in the Eastern Settlement but not further north on the West Coast of Greenland. Also present in Greenlandic waters (and occasionally elsewhere) are the high arctic seals wintering in the ice- the small Ringed Seal (Phoca hispida) and the large Bearded seal (Erignathus barbatus). While regularly taken by Inuit hunters, these species are trace elements in the Norse collections. The impact of expanding sea ice at the end of the Medieval Climate Anomaly ca. 1275-1300 is visible in archaeofauna in Iceland (which show in influx of Harp seal bones) and in SW Greenland (where harbor seal colonies were adversely impacted). Commercial seal hunting was a feature of early modern European expansion into the N Atlantic and Arctic, with substantial impacts on seal populations by mid-20th century.

### Examples:


* Harp seal (Pagophilius groenlandicus) hunting played a key role in the Dorset and Saqqaq cultures in prehistoric Labrador and Greenland, and later provided a mainstay of Thule Inuit hunters in the same regions.

* Hunting of common/harbor (Phoca vitulina) and hooded seals in Iceland was closely regulated to avoid over-exploitation, and rights to sealing beaches could be owned by distant landlords.

* In Greenland, even inland sites show substantial numbers of seal bones (from the whole skeleton) suggesting a communal hunt and distribution of carcasses. Seal consumption may have been class related (small farms show higher % of seal) but all Norse Greenlanders seem to have consumed far more seal meat than their contemporaries in Iceland or the mainland.
