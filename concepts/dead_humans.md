## Dead Humans 

###  Scope note: 
“Dead humans” structure the landscape in many unique ways. Burial grounds are created for the dead, often accompanied by or in the form of monumental structures. Throughout the Northern Atlantic world, certain monumental features are shared in connection with the burial of dead humans, such as grave-mounds, stone-settings, both carved and undecorated standing stones. Such monuments for the dead make burials not only visible in the landscape, but also provide important waymarks and features for demarcation. In Mediæval laws and diplomas, burial grounds, and monuments play an important role in marking boundaries and inheritance and ownership rights. In many cases, dead humans serve as name-giving patrons for landscape features and other place-names. Dead humans also appear to charge landscapes with or relate to the existing sacredness of a place. 

Anatomically modern humans (Homo sapiens) are a species of bipedal mammal that evolved in Africa at least 300,000 years ago (Hublin et al. 2017). Humans, among other things, require the uptake of atmospheric oxygen (O2) to survive, which they convert and later release as carbon dioxide (CO2). As long as this cycle of breath known as respiration continues regularly, a human is considered alive. If respiration fails for long enough, a human is dead. A dead human will eventually decay and lose most (if not all) of the physical structures that characterized it as a biological being. As a result of this process, the physical bodies of dead humans are often highly ephemeral. In some cases, however, the bones of dead humans can preserve for hundreds or even thousands of years (Stodder 2008).

### Examples: 

* Mediæval Icelandic texts like Eyrbyggja saga (ch. IV) tell of the people’s belief that one would ‘die into the mountain’, namely the nearby Helgafell (literally ‘holy mountain’). This means that dead members of the local communities were believed to carry on a form of afterlife, joining other relatives, in certain features in the landscape.
* In 1912, a very large ocean liner boat known as the Titanic collided with an iceberg in the North Atlantic Ocean (https://www.britannica.com/topic/Titanic). The collision caused the boat to sink. As a result, over 1,500 dead people were left at sea.
