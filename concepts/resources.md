## Resources 

###  Scope note: 
"Resources" is a concept that refers to all the resources invovled with the management and cultivation of their landscape. It refers to both the physical resources present on a landscape and the cognitive resources manifested through human action. Vegetation cover and grazing potential, wild terrestrial and marine animals as well as birds and insects, domestic animals and their products, and the legal, cultural and social aspects of all of this are covered by this term. At the most basic level this has to do with soil, water, the organisms living within, on, and above these as well as the cultural and social schema that developed for the defining and management of these systems. Humans themselves, in terms of carriers of cognitive resources as well as sources of direct action are encompassed by this concept. Traditional ecological knowledge, memory, law and art all can be aspects of the human cognitive aspects of this concept. Fertilization, landesque capital, or the retained impacts of past natural and human activities on the landscape, animal and plant breeding, and landscape engineering in terms of soil and water movement are all physical aspects of this concept.
