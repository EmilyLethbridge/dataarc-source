### Baleen

###  Scope note:
"Baleen and whale bone” refer to hard tissues derived from hunted or stranded whales that may be acquired via legal or illegal salvage, purchase, or trade. The value and material utility of bone and baleen were dependent upon the species from which they were acquired. Whale bone was a commonly used raw material for a wide array of objects and items of varying status and is found on archaeological sites across premodern Europe and the North Atlantic. Whale bone, when found in well-preserved contexts, may be identified by ZooMS (Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry) or ancient DNA analysis, or less often by morphological analysis. Baleen is found more rarely in archaeological contexts and may be identified by the same analytical processes.

### Examples:

* While species information may be derived from bone or baleen using morphological, genetic, or other molecular analysis, the means of acquisition is typically not discernable in the absence of clear and abundant patterns of bones found within or among archaeological sites.

* Whale bones and baleen defy regular or typical zooarchaeological analysis on archaeological sites because they are not butchered on or near sites. Whale bones in particular are difficult to use in estimating the quantity or frequency of cetacean presence on sites.

* Certain types of artifacts made from whale bone or baleen, especially gaming pieces or working tools, have been proposed a possible indicator of reliance upon whales within certain cultures or economies.
