## Ecological Area 

###  Scope note: 
An "ecological area" is a space that possesses unique environmental and biological traits and species. It consists of natural communities and species (e.g., flora, fauna, and environment) with shared characteristics in a geographic area. Ecological areas are a component within the larger complex system (i.e., the ecosystem) and ecological network. Ecological networks include areas, corridors, and buffer zones. Corridors connect areas and allow for wildlife to travel between ecosystems, while buffer zones offer protection around areas. Because of this, ecological areas may be managed by municipalities who seek to encourage and sustain these areas through conservation and protection, which is often in response to mounting pressures (e.g., development and industrialization) and threaten natural land and bodies of water. Conservation may include assessments that consider connectivity in the landscape, water quality and recharge, habitat, especially for species of heightened concern, and outstanding examples of plant and/or animal communities.

### Examples: 

* The Nova Scotia Highlands—ranging from Chignecto Bay to Cape Breton Island—is comprised of a climate with an average annual temperature of 5.5°C and average annual precipitation of 1100–1600 mm; vegetation of a mixed wood forest (e.g., maples, birch, spruce, and fir); landforms of the Cobequid Mountains, the Antigonish Highlands, and Cape Breton Hills; and wildlife including white-tailed deer, moose, black bear, snowshoe hare, fisher, coyote, and porcupine (Webb and Marshall 1999). Thus, this region and ecological area has many shared environmental, ecological, and biological characteristics.
* Regionally Significant Ecological Areas are unique and threatened ecosystems, which are overseen by the state of Minnesota to encourage conservation and protection, as well as enjoyment of natural resources by local communities.
