## Geochronology 

###  Scope note: 
"Geochronology" is a branch of geology that deals with aging rock formations and geological events. In order to date rocks and establish geological chronologies, scientists use a variety of isotopic dating methods that measure the radioactive decay of elements with varying numbers of neutrons in the nuclei, known as isotopes (Jäger 1979). These elements include potassium (K), Rubidium (Rb), Uranium (U), Thorium (Th), Samarium (Sm), and Rhenium (Re). Another increasingly popular dating method used by geochronologists is known as fission track dating. This method tracks the rate of spontaneous fission among a particular Uranium isotope. Using dates obtained using these methods, geochronologists are able to track the extent and history of specific strata spatially as well as examine sequences of geological events in a certain place through time (Schmitz and Kuiper 2013). Within the North Atlantic region, Iceland is characterized by a young geological age and high tectonic activity, leading to volcanic activities which continuously create new rock strata and landscape features. This has also helped in producing a detailed tephrochronology for the island, based on the ash layers (i.e. tephra) from volcanic eruptions, which provide unique stratigraphic indicators for geochronology.

### Examples: 

* The so-called ‘settlement layer’ (c.870 –880 CE) in Icelandic geochronology marks the most recent tephra layer before the settlement (or landnám) of Iceland (Karl Grönvald et al. 1995; Karl Grönvold 2000; Schmid et al. 2017).
* In the North Atlantic, scientists used geochronological techniques to date rift-related faulting events in the Faroe Islands, northeast Atlantic margin (Roberts and Walker 2016). Their findings showed faulting processes that continued for a longer period following the onset of Atlantic Ocean spreading than previously thought.
