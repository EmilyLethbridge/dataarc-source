### Scope notes

Erosion is the removal and transport of soil (or rock) from one locaiton to another location by surface procceses. The dominant erosive processes depend on the wider environment, but in temperate areas may be water, wind and snow. Eroded sediment can be transported long distancs before deposition. Rates of erosion are controlled by a wide range of drivers, and the relative importance of these varies. Climate and anthropogenic activity (especially agriculture) are two key drivers, but soils vary significantly in their underlying vulnerability. 

### Examples

* The break down of vegetation cover leads to the development of erosion spots. This bare sediment is much more vulnerable to erosion, and soil is removed by aeolian and fluvial processes. Once vegetation cover is lost, erosion can remove large volumes of sediment in short periods of time. This process occurs over large parts of Iceland. 

* Andosols (soils derived from volcanic material) are highly vulnerable to erosion, becuase of their low cohesion. 

* Eroded sediments in Iceland can be blown considerable distances, and increased rates of sediment accumulation are recorded in terrestial, lake and marine sediments.
