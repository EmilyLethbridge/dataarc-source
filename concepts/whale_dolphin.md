## aka cetaceans

###  Scope note:
"Cetaceans" includes whales, dolphins, and porpoise, a populous and diverse set of species of marine mammals considered to be among the most important drivers of marine food webs across the world’s oceans. Along with polar bears, walrus, and seals, cetaceans were prominent in medieval North Atlantic and European economies and literary and religious traditions, even though the magnitude of these contributions remains largely incalculable due to inadequate historical and archaeological evidence. Cetaceans are often described and depicted in medieval literature and art as sea monsters. The means of acquisition of cetaceans throughout the premodern world highly debated, focusing especially on whether large whales could be hunted or were merely used when stranded.

### Examples:

* Whale soft tissues were used for food and fuel, while bones were used as fuel, raw material for a broad number of tools and crafts. Dolphin and porpoise were primarily valued as food sources. All cetaceans were classified and sold at markets as “cold flesh” and therefore consumable on Christian holy days, as they were not considered animal meat.

* Across premodern Europe, large whales were used when stranded, although portions of certain species or sizes were designated as royal or church property. Taboos were held for certain species which were conceived as malevolent and potentially poisonous in some traditions.

* Molecular evidence and preindustrial population reconstructions indicate that cetacean populations were far more expansive in premodernity, making the animals themselves much larger and the potential for strandings on land or cetacean encounters at sea far more regular.
