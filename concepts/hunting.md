###  Scope note: 
"Hunting" denotes the intentional pursuit and capture or killing of wild marine and terrestrial mammals and birds for purposes of procuring food or other animal products.

### Examples: 

* Seal hunting in Iceland and Scotland was comparatively small-scale and centered on non-migratory harbor seals which could easily be over-exploited.  In Greenland Norse settlers encountered a new suite of seals including the ice-riding migratory Harp and Hooded seals as well as the arctic ice edge and breathing hole Ringed and Bearded seals. Norse Greenlanders intensively hunted the migratory seals but did not regularly take the arctic seals requiring harpoon and ice hunting technology.

* In the Faroe Islands sea bird hunting remained a key element in subsistence from pre-Norse times to the near present.  

* Viking Age hunting of Walrus was motivated by a market for walrus-tusk ivory and walrus-hide rope and may have been a major motivation for initial settlement in both Iceland and Greenland.  Medieval Greenlanders may have serially depleted walrus populations through an expanded long- range hunt.
