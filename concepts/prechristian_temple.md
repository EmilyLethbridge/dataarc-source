## Prechristian temple

###  Scope note:
A "prechristian temple" is a general term used to designate any building or structure that might have been used for the practise of pre-Christian religious ritual. After 1000 C.E. Iceland converted to Christianity but some adherence to pre-Christian traditions presumably continued in private. Elaborate descriptions of pre-Christian temples are found in the later medieval Sagas of Icelanders (e.g. in Kjalnesinga saga) but for the most part, the detail in these descriptions is believed to be antiquarian invention. Place-name evidence (e.g. toponyms containing the element 'hof') was important in 19th- and 20th-century archaeologists' search for pagan temples but a recent re-assessment of this evidence (by Orri Vésteinsson) is that a 'hof' was a community feasting hall and centre for socio-political activities, becoming a centre of resistance to Christianity by the late 10th century.
