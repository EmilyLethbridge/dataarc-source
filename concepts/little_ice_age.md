### Little Ice Age

### Scope note:

The term 'Little Ice Age' denotes a period of climatic cooling and increased climatic variability experienced across large parts of the world over AD 1300-1900. There is considerable debate as to the precise period the Little Ice Age encompases, and also the regional varaibility in its onset, intensity and end date. During the Little Ice Age glaciers increased in extent and, for part of this period at least, Northern Hemisphere summer temperatures were below the 20th century mean. Key sources of evidence for the Little Ice Age come from reconstructions of glacial extent, palaeoclimate reconstructions and documentary sources. The climatic changes associated with the Little Ice Age have been implicated in changes to societies across the North Atlantic region. 

### Examples:

* During the Little Ice Age glaciers increased in extent, notably in Iceland and the Alps

* Sea ice cover increased significantly in extent and duration in the area north of Iceland

* Reducing summer temperatures increased the likelihood of crop failure in north-western Europe
