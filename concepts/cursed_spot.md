## Cursed Spot 

###  Scope note: 
A "cursed spot" (álagablettur) is a small area (often close to a farm) that is said to be under some kind of enchantment or spell. If the place is not treated correctly, bad consequences will ensue. Many folktales (þjóðsögur) include details about these enchanted places and stories associated with them.  


### Examples: 

* Álagablettur in Ekkjufellsland in Fellahreppur (eastern Iceland) where the grass should not be mown (oral account here https://www.ismus.is/i/audio/uid-74ea594e-cec2-4d60-b517-ebde49012833)
* Álagablettur at Núpur in Öxarfjörður (northeast Iceland) where the grass should not be mown; when it was, horses on the farm broke their legs and sheep died (oral account here https://www.ismus.is/i/audio/uid-0122f3ce-1e96-4ba1-82a0-a2c45de0c90b)
