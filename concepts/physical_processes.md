## Physical Processes 

###  Scope note: 
"Physical processes" refer to processes that affect the Earth, such as erosion, weather, sediment deposition, tectonic activity on the Earth’s crust. Because of this, the processes are responsible for shaping the Earth’s surface. Physical aspects of the Earth are linked to life processes, such as soils, temperature, and water flow. These are complex systems, where the interactions between different processes can lead to changes of states (e.g., landscape and environmental changes). Furthermore, they are inextricably linked to human processes and cannot be understood without them. This is because of the effect of anthropogenic change on the Earth’s systems.

### Examples: 

* At Langholt, North Iceland, many Viking age archaeological sites are buried under centuries of occupational strata or through extensive soil deposition (Steinberg et al. 2016). The occupational strata accumulate over time due to the many generations of (re)building episodes, which can create artificial farm mounds as a result (i.e., leading to landscape changes). In this region, the soil deposition is mainly from wind blow sediments (i.e., aeolian soil deposition). The aeolian sediments can layer on top of sites while they are unoccupied, then a new site could be built on top of that layer.
