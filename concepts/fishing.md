## Fishing

###  Scope note:
Archaeological evidence for both marine and freshwater fishing extend at least to the Mesolithic in Scandinavia and NW Europe. However intensified marine fishing combined with fish preservation techniques (air drying of cod-family fish) probably developed in northern Norway’s Lofoten and Vesteralen region during the Iron Age had a transformative impact during the Viking Age. A key zooarchaeological signature of early Scandinavian presence in the Scottish Northern and Western Isles is an increase in deep water fishing focused on cod-family species. In Iceland, inland farms were being provisioned with preserved marine fish from first settlement (ca. 850-875 CE) and by 1250-1300 dried cod became the major Icelandic export product. Deep water fishing combined with drying technology seems to have been introduced to Britain and continental Europe ca. 950-1000 by Viking Age Scandinavians, providing a lasting legacy that was to transform maritime economies globally. Work making use of multiple radiocarbon dates, stable isotopes, and ancient DNA analyses by teams led by James Barrett and David Orton has traced the fish “supply chains” that provisioned medieval and early modern London, and these techniques are greatly expanding understanding of the origins and spread of marine fisheries in Europe and the North Atlantic. Freshwater fishing (mainly focusing on salmon, trout, and char) is best documented in the Icelandic Myvatn area, but certainly played a role in subsistence elsewhere.

### Examples:

* “Producer” and “consumer” signatures are visible archaeologically by comparing recovered frequency of bones from the head and body parts recovered. Coastal producer sites accumulate disproportionate amounts of heads, while the body parts (mainly vertebrae) accumulate on consumer sites inland.

* While Nordic households back to the Iron Age seem to have regularly provisioned themselves with cod family fish dried either split and flattened or in left in the round, the round dried product became the core of the international “stockfish” trade by the 14th century, with the Germanic Hanseatic traders dominating later medieval trade in Scandinavia.

* While some marine fish bones are present in Greenlandic Norse sites, seals rather than fish seem to have been the core subsistence resource and fishing never took on the importance it had in Iceland in later medieval times.
