### Administrative Unit/Farm 

###  Scope note: 
A "farm" denotes an area of land and farmstead devoted to agricultural production such as growing crops and keeping livestock. A traditional farm tends to keep both animals (such as sheep and cattle) and growing crops (such as wheat, barley, and flax) often combining lands used for crop production with lands used for fodder and grazing. Evidence of farming activities in the landscape and functionality for prehistoric and historic farms can be analyzed by looking at plant macrofossils, fossil beetles, geochemistry, animal bones, and pollen records. This material can be sampled during excavations around the farmstead hearths, post holes, wells, and nearby lakes and bogs can provide general information on a landscape level.

In the context of the North Atlantic, Norse settlers began cultivating the land and rearing livestock in both Iceland and Greenland when they were first colonized, forming the basis of their subsistence and economy. In Iceland, farms have been a constant feature in the landscape. Most farmsteads were established during the Viking Age and the core elements of the farmsteads were generally repaired or rebuilt in the same location throughout the centuries. This distribution was similar in Greenland, where farming was introduced by the Norse and farms were dispersed throughout the landscape. Estimates of Norse population in Greenland have been made based on the number and size of farms, as farms were directly correlated with population numbers at the time.


### Examples: 

* Sheep farming in the North Atlantic has been important for human survival for thousands of years, particularly in Scotland and Norway, producing wool resources as well as meat and milk. Sheep grazing is an important factor in shaping the landscape and the biodiversity of a region. However, unmanaged or overly large sheep populations can cause overgrazing, which can lead to problems with soil erosion, such as in Iceland that has a severe problem of soil loss.
* From the 11th to the 12th century, farming strategies in Iceland had altered in line with the environmental impact these practices were having. Pig and goat numbers decreased dramatically and largely disappeared and were instead replaced by cattle and sheep.
* Þjórsárdalur, an area with several farms some of which were occupied into the 20th century. Most farms in the area were abandoned in the 12th century due to the eruption of the nearby volcano Hekla in 1104. 
* By sampling sediment within early Norse farm buildings at Toftanes, Faroe Islands, a multiproxy approach analyzing pollen, seed macrofossils and fossil beetles show the possibility to begin to study long-term human activity and farming economy as seen from the living conditions of abandoned farmsteads.
* The longhouse was a common farm structure used from the Neolithic until the Viking Age in the North Atlantic. This structure had clearly defined living space, cooking areas, storage, and byres.
