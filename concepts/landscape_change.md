## Landscape Change 

###  Scope note: 
"Landscape change" is the result of nature and society having a cumulative impact on the environment. Landscape change is dynamic, which is driven by many different forces and processes, and can occur at different rates of change. It can be natural and/or anthropogenic, such as climate change, land use, and development. Further, natural landscape changes can be exacerbated by anthropogenic actions and vice-a-versa, which could push the landscape into change that is unsustainable. It is a significant driver of environmental change with implications related to ecosystems, natural resources, biodiversity, and variability and change. Landscape change is also not random and is impacted by land use, which has implications for spatial patterns of change and the underlying ecological processes and species distribution. Change can be minimal or can result in a drastically different landscape forming, and will have varying influences on the wildlife in a region. As landscapes change, areas can increasingly be distanced and cut off from one another, which can limit the flow of species between areas and can diminish habitat and resources for both plant and animal species.

### Examples: 

* Landscape change as a result of industrialization and urbanization may have major implications for the local environment. The amount of covered and utilized land dramatically increases and the surrounding natural areas begin experiencing the impact of anthropopressure. These pressures are caused by factors such as mining, area build-up, and industrial areas.
* Glaciers can erode and shape the landscape beneath them and deposit sediment in new locations as they move and melt.
