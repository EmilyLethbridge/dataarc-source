## Things 

###  Scope note: 
"Things" is a general category, comprised of discrete, identifiable, persistent objects (following the CIDOC CRM E70 definition). Things are physical, they consist of matter, and generally have a solid or liquid physical form, and are characterized by relative stability.

### Examples: 

* The significant increase in the circulation of material objects - things - in the early modern period is associated with a fundamental shift in economic relationships with groups outside of Iceland. 
* A wide variety of things are given as gifts in the Icelandic Sagas.
* Increasing consistency in the physical form of manufactured things of a variety of types is assoicated with shifts in modes of production towards standardization.
