## Volcanic Activity

###  Scope note: 

Iceland currently has 32 active volcanic centres and there have been approximately 20 eruptions over the past 50 years. Volcanic activity in Iceland can be devided into two main types explosive and effusive. Many of Icelands volcanoes are covered by glaciers and explosive eruptions can occur when any magma (including basaltic) interacts with water from melting overlying ice. Intermediate to silicic magmas are viscous and contain relatively high gas contents, which result in explosive eruptions, with or without the presence of water. The tephra (volcanic ash) produced by explosive activity can cover large parts of the country and become incorporated into the soils to form tephra layers, which are used to date environmental and archaeological contexts (tephrochronology). Subglacial eruptions can also result in massive glacial outburst floods, called jökulhlaups. Effusive eruptions of basaltic magma with no or little interaction with ice and water, can produce extensive lava flows, which in historical times have covered large areas. Both types of activity can have a direct impact on the environment and people, through the hazards caused by tephra fall on farmland and associated health implications, jökulhalups, gases produced by eruptions (sometimes attached to tephra layers) and the physical loss of land covered by lava flows. 

### Examples: 

* The 1362 eruption of Öræfajökull (SE Iceland) produced a jökulhlaup that devastated nearby farmland resulting in the area being renamed "Öræfi", meaning wasteland.

* Thick tephra deposition can lead to the abandonment of farms due to impacts on grasslands and livestock and people. For example the impact of the Hekla 1104 eruption in Þjórsardalur.

* The presence of tephra layers allows us to use tephrochronology to reconstruct environmental change and human impacts, such as in Skaftátunga.

* The 1783 Laki eruption produced approximately 15 cubic kilometres of lava which directly affected SE Iceland, as well as large quantities of sulfur dioxide and fluorine. The resultant Haze Famine in Iceland killed a quarter of the populations (9300 people), with about 23,000 excess deaths recorded in England (July to September 1783).
