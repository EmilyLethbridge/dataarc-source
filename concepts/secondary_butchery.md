
## Secondary Butchery

###  Scope note: 
"Secondary Butchery" denotes the dismemberment of an animal carcass at the joints or division of main muscle groups to divide large portions of meat. This is distinct from tertiary butchery, which produces cuts of meat suitable for household scale cooking. 

### Examples: 

* Secondary butchery is evidenced by the pattern of cut marks on animal bones, including sheep and cattle bones. Varied primary butchery cut marks and consistent secondary butchery cut marks may indicate redistribution of meat. 

* At Litlibaer the types of fish bones present as refuse indicate the localized practice of secondary butchery, separate from primary butchery which took place in another location.
