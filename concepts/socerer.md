## Sorcerer / Sorceress 

###  Scope note: 
A individual, male or female, who practises magic, possibly in a wider pre-Christian relgious context. In the sagas (various genres), there are many figures who work magic to good or bad ends: to influence the course of events, to conceal, to influence the weather. One type of magic is 'seiðr', practised by a 'völva' (a seeress). Staffs found in Viking Age burial contexts have been interpreted as the staffs that are mentioned in written sources as part of a völva's outfit.  

### Examples: 

* Þorbjörg lítilvölva in Eiríks saga rauða
* Katla the witch in Eyrbyggja saga
* Þorgrímur nef in Gísla saga Súrssonar
