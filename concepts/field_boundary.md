## Field Boundary 

###  Scope note: 
A “field boundary” is the marking of the extent of a field. They can either define ownership over the area of managed land located around a farm, or internally separate a farm’s fields used for grazing or cultivating crops for better property management. Field boundaries often emerge as part of land use, tenure, and cultivation and, at times, denote a division between neighboring farms. Johnson (2005, 13) refers to the construction of boundaries as being “an altogether different approach to identity, place and tenure”. 

Field boundaries are often man-made structures located alongside the edges of the farm fields and pasture areas. They can take many forms, including but not limited to fences, dry-stone walls, terrace walls, and clearance cairns. In the North Atlantic, archaeological and historical farm sites often have field boundaries defined by turf walls, with modern examples using fences or stone walls. 


### Examples: 

* In parts of Denmark during the transition between the Late Bronze Age and Early Pre-Roman Iron Age cultivated fields began showcasing enclosed field boundaries. Celtic fields were distinguished by earth embankments, lynchets, or stone walls.
* Norse farms often had outbuildings on the edge of homefields, which are the fields directly surrounding the main domestic structure. These outbuildings would help to define the boundaries for some of these home fields, as well as traditional field boundaries. In the Late Medieval and Early Modern period more than one household would sometimes share homefields.
* Dartmoor (England) has some surviving examples of Bronze Age field boundary systems. Johnston (2005) theorized that the links between buildings and boundaries demonstrate that the location of stone walls, banks and other field boundaries was dependent on the location of the farmstead buildings, such that the buildings would form part of the boundary.

* Hedges - these were often formed by low bushes and/or shrubs growing closely together around the field.
* Fences - these could be wooden in their entirety or a combination of wooden stakes and wire.
* Turf Walls - they were turf built up to form a low boundary between fields.
* Dry-Stone Walls - a dry stone wall was traditionally used to show field boundaries, these were sometimes constructed using stone collected when clearing the field. 58 dry-stone walls, terrace walls, and clearance cairns (which could also perform the function of field boundaries) were recorded in Ornes (Norway) in 1865, delineating the different farm areas.
* Roundpole fences - these, known as gärsgård (deriving from gærþe meaning enclosed area) in Scandinavia, were constructed using young trees and branches as poles and binding cords and was commonly used in Scandinavia to mark field boundaries.
