## Moss 

###  Scope note: 
"Moss" is either the vegetation type or material of low growing, moisure loving plants of the Byrophyta taxonomic group. (Sphagnum) moss makes up the majority of most peats, but other species will grow in damp environments on stone. Many mosses have been used by people, ranging from as toilet 'paper', wall insulation, padding between planks in boats, dressing wounds to lining meditation gardens.

### Examples: 

* Sphagnum moss is considered biologically inert and possibly anticeptic, and has thus been used historically for cleaning wounds
* Peat bogs, predominantly consisting of compacted, dead moss, have been harvested as building material (turn walls) and fuel in northern Europe for centuries
* Moss growing on ancient monuments made of stone (e.g. runestones, rock art, buildings) may damage the material and may be removed by conservators to preserve the monument
