## Actors

###  Scope note: 
"Actors" is the equivalend of the CIDOC CRM E39 Actor class. This class comprises people, either individually or in groups, who have the potential to perform intentional actions of kinds for which someone may be held responsible.
 
The CRM does not attempt to model the inadvertent actions of such actors. Individual people should be documented as instances of E21 Person, whereas groups should be documented as instances of either E74 Group or its subclass E40 Legal Body.

### Examples: 

* Grettis
