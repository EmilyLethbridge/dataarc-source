## Walrus

###  Scope note:
Walrus (Odobenus rosmarus) increasingly became targets of systematic human hunting in the Viking Age and medieval North Atlantic. Walrus tusk ivory was widely traded as supplement or substitute for elephant ivory and the thick and resilient hide was used as top-quality ships line. Recent research by multiple research teams making use of zooarchaeology, medieval literature, trace elements, stable isotopes, and ancient DNA (aDNA) evidence has greatly expanded understanding of the hunt and its impact on the distribution and genetics of walrus. A genetically distinct population of walrus inhabited Iceland at first settlement c. 850-875 CE, and bones from adults and very young walrus have been recovered from multiple early sites in Iceland, with a concentration in the Reykjavik area. Walrus-element place names also concentrate in the SW, but walrus bones have been recovered from all parts of Iceland. The Icelandic walrus population seems to have been driven to extinction within about a century, probably providing motivation for the colonization of Greenland ca. 985 CE. Greenlandic and Canadian walrus populations were apparently more resilient, but by ca. 1100 walrus in Greenland seem to have been taken mainly in the Disko Bay region (ca. 800 km north of the nearest Norse farm). Osteometric and aDNA evidence indicates that late medieval Norse hunters may have depleted the Disko Bay population and had shifted to hunting the North Water polynya populations in the Thule District (over 1000 km further north) with associated increase in labor costs and hazard. The Norse “Norðurseta” walrus hunt in Greenland was a core activity for the small colony from its beginning down to its extinction ca. 1450, and ultimately seems to have been bad for both humans and walrus. A genetically distinct Canadian walrus population in the Gulf of St. Lawrence was later driven to extinction by European hunters ca. 1750.

### Examples:

* Walrus hunting is increasingly recognized as a significant driver of Norse colonization efforts in both Iceland and Greenland, with the “white gold” of ivory as important as the “green gold” of pastureland featured in the sagas. The importance of the pioneering walrus hunters seems to have been conveniently “forgotten” by the time the literary settlement histories were being commissioned by Icelandic chieftains after 1150.

* Isotopic and aDNA evidence indicates that ca. 1100-1400 Greenlandic walrus dominated the European market, possibly aided by the establishment of the bishopric at Gardar 1127.

* Walrus bones were built into the outside of the turf wall of the 9th c. hall at Aðalstraeti under modern downtown Reykjavik and three tusks (of different animals) were left inside at abandonment. Both cranial and post-cranial walrus bones were recovered from what may be associated midden deposits nearby.

* The demands of the long distance Norðurseta hunt for boats and active adults in the small Greenlandic community (probably less than 3,000 at maximum) created serious conflict with the farming / hunting subsistence economy based on the farms far to the south.
