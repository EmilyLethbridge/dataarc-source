## Bishop's church

###  Scope note:

The central church in a diocese. Iceland had two dioceses up until 1801 when they were merged to form the Diocese of Iceland. The southern diocese of Skálholt was the estate of the first Bishop in Iceland, Gizurr Ísleifsson, and it was established in 1056. The northern diocese of Hólar was established in 1106 and Jón Ögmundarson was its first bishop.
