### Abandonment 

###  Scope note: 
"Abandonment" denotes the intentional relocation of activity away from a formerly inhabited or actively managed place. It is associated with the cessation of practices intended to maintain or improve conditions in a managed place. 

### Examples: 

* Decreased tephra accummulation rates in farm site tephra sequence sometimes can be interpreted as indicative of vegetation regrowth, which in turn is read as an indicator of land abandonment. 
* The collapse of built structures and fencing at farm sites is interpreted as indicative of complete abandonment. 
* The abandonment of a fishing outpost, interpreted based on the cessation of waste accummulation in a midden, may be connected to changing availability of fish stocks in the local coastal waters.
