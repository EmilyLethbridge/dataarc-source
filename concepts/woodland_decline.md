## Woodland Decline 

###  Scope note: 
"Woodland decline" is the change in coverage and loss of trees in an area of the landscape. Natural events or manmade activities can cause this change or loss. For example, agricultural production, grazing, climate change and movement or change in local herbivore species (e.g. deer) can all result in declining woodland. This decline of forests and woodland can be a prolonged process or can happen rapidly, depending on the driving factor causing the change.

Woodland decline has taken place throughout the North Atlantic (particularly in Scotland, Iceland, and the Faroe Islands), often due to human influence, but also in part from climatic changes. Woodland decline is associated with Norse colonization, particularly in Iceland, as timber was a vital resource, providing fuel, allowing for charcoal production and was an important building material. In certain landscapes in the North Atlantic the decline of forests can result in the depletion and erosion of the soil which some areas might not recover from.

### Examples: 

* Decline of woodland in Orkney
* The Elm Decline might have been caused by a combination of elm bark beetles, climate change, and the expansion of agriculture. Although, the correlation between these factors is still uncertain.
* Landnám events during the Norse colonization of the North Atlantic isles, Greenland, Iceland, and Faroe Islands, has resulted in the decline of forests or increased the rate of decline due to climate change. This exacerbated the soil erosion already caused by grazing as well as creating difficulties when searching for wood for construction and fuel.
* Early paleoecology in the Scottish uplands was dominated by tree pollen, showing a steady decline from the Neolithic period onwards. It is thought that a combination of agricultural activities, increasing population, grazing pressures, and changing soil conditions have led to woodland decline in these areas, although these patterns vary spatially.
* At Þjórsárdalur, Iceland the steady decline of birch woodland coverage from 1587-1938 has been extensively mapped. Over a period of 350 years, 94% of woodland cover was depleted. This woodland was used for fuel and charcoal, with socio-economic development and the form of ownership being the main driving force for this depletion.
* Evidence of charcoal production has been found in the stratigraphy at Eyjafjallahreppur, Southern Iceland. This can then be linked to declining woodland cover within that area through time.
