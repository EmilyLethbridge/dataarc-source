## Pasture / Dung 

###  Scope note: "Pasture / Dung" ecosystems are associated with grazed land of varying form. Paleo-ecological evidence for these environments includes most dung beetles, including those that are not stenotopic to dung. These are mostly open landscapes, but may include pasture-woodland when in combination with species tied to either the actual wood, trees or the forest/woodland environment.
