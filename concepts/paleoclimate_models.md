## Paleoclimate Model 

###  Scope note: 
Paleoclimatology is the study of Earth’s past climates using proxies such as tree rings, pollen, ice sheets and glaciers, cave deposits, sediments, and coral, from the environment. These proxies are sensitive to climatic variability and can be processed to reveal time signatures, such as the rings of a tree. Paleoclimate reconstructions are based on the uniformitarian principle that the proxies in the present react to environmental changes the same way that they reacted to changes in the past. Paleoclimate modelling primarily relies on computer climate models—including the physical processes of the climate system. These models are used to understand the natural cycles of Earth’s climate, climate change, past climate, and the complex array of factors affecting climate. An understanding of the past helps scientists to understand climate processes today and to predict future changes, especially the impact that humans have on the climate. Paleoclimate models are important for understanding the many factors that can contribute to climate change and multiple environmental responses to climate change. Paleoclimate models can be used to better calibrate future climate models by comparing the output of numerical simulations and paleoclimatology data. Then, researchers combine these data to gain a greater understanding of climate change in the past and in the future. The scales of paleoclimate models range from local to global. Larger scale paleoclimate models, such as a General Circulation Model—simulated climate based on variables such as solar radiation and atmospheric pressure—provide information on large scale processes, climate feedbacks, and climate forcing (e.g., volcanic eruptions). Local to regional scale paleoclimate reconstructions are important as they expose environmental variability across space and time at a scale relevant to human activity. Paleoclimate modelling allows for a better understanding of the effects of climate-driven variability on past societies.


### Examples: 

* In much of the North Atlantic and Europe, the Little Ice Age (LIA; ca. AD 1300–1850), had devastating impacts on crops, livestock, and human health, which led to starvation, famine, and disease (Fagan 2000). The LIA has been recorded through many paleoclimate proxies and reconstructions. For example, Anders Moberg and colleagues (2005) reconstructed temperatures for the Northern Hemisphere for the past 2,000 years by combining seven tree-ring series and eleven low-resolution proxy series, which shows lower temperatures for the LIA.
* One conceptual model is the effect that volcanic eruptions have, and subsequent dust and aerosols, on solar radiation in the Earth. 
* Paleoclimate models of variations in the carbon cycle and how human activities can impact the cycle, and therefore the climate.
