## Gathering

###  Scope note:
“Social gathering” refers to all sorts of opportunities (regular or ad hoc) for members of a society to meet and interact. In the Norse North Atlantic, regular meetings at local, regional, and national level assemblies (Thing) were a key element for governance but also for conducting commerce, making marriage and other kinship relationships (fostering, adoption, care of elders and disabled, divorce and property division). Pagan ritual seems to have involved periodic gatherings tied to a seasonal round of holidays and Christianization brought the need for regular attendance in churches for mass and holy days plus baptisms, marriages, burials, and investiture ceremonies. Gatherings thus were key social events that directly impacted biological survival (finding marriage partners), validation of community membership (with rights and obligations), coordination of communal work activities (often hay harvest, wall construction, hunting, fishing, and fowling), access to imported goods, and emotional and spiritual well-being. Settlement pattern greatly impacted the costs of maintaining social connections. While Faroese villagers could maintain face to face contact easily on a daily basis, most Icelandic farms were 2-3 km apart and Greenlandic farms might be 10-20 km from the nearest church center. Isolation in winter was often extreme in these circumstances. Orri Vésteinsson argues that social isolation may be a major factor in medieval farm abandonment decisions (as it is in modern Scandinavia).

### Examples:

* Multi-tiered Thing system imported from mainland Scandinavia and best documented in Iceland provided a set of assemblies that had legal governance responsibilities as well as providing opportunities for commerce and social interactions of all kinds. Thing systems have been seen as early parliamentary democracy but may be better understood as an element in widespread Germanic leveling mechanisms constraining elite (esp. royal) power.

*  Church attendance in medieval and early modern times was compulsory and non-attendees could be fined or otherwise disciplined. Travel costs to mass were sometimes non-trivial, especially in Greenland.

*  Fairs and markets often were associated with Thing meetings, but by the 13th c seasonal trading centers (like Gásir in Eyjafjord) provided other venues for meeting outsiders and other community members.
