## Wetlands and Marshes 

###  Scope note: "Wetlands and Marsh" habitats are identified in the paleo-ecological record on the basis of beetle, insect or plant species which are water tolerant but not living specifically in the water. These may include mud and bank species, as well as those moss & reed dwellers that prefer permanently wet environments.
