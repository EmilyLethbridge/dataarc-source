## Storminess 

###  Scope note: 
"torminess,” or the state of being stormy, refers to periods of atmospheric disturbance that involve low barometric pressure, increased cloud cover and precipitation, strong winds, and possibly lightning and thunder (https://www.britannica.com/science/storm). Due to prevailing wind currents in the North Atlantic region, pockets of storminess occur and follow somewhat predictable paths known as storm tracks. Brayshaw et al. (2009, 2011) argue that North Atlantic storm tracks are influenced by a variety of interdependent factors, namely land-sea contrasts (differences in temperature and humidity between neighboring continental and ocean regions), orography (the location and elevation of mountain ranges), and varying sea surface temperatures. Shifts in North Atlantic storm tracks along a north-south axis are documented over the last 4,000 years (Orme et al. 2017), indicating considerable temporal and spatial variability in the amount and distribution of storminess across the North Atlantic region. Woolings et al. (2012) demonstrate that the movement of storm tracks in the North Atlantic is also occurring today at a rapid rate, likely in response to changing climatic factors associated with increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Beyond being a purely physical phenomenon, storms play a broad range of roles in the Northern Atlantic region. Due to their different geomorphology and other factors, the individual areas of the (supra-)region are differently affected by storms. As a result of their human occupation and the loss of naturally occurring tree-growth caused by the settlers for different reasons, most of the inhabited islands in the North Atlantic, have become extremely barren and thus even more vulnerable to stormy weathers. Most importantly, perhaps, storms heavily influenced pre-Modern sail-driven seafaring both in terms of travel-speed and risks while at sea. 

### Examples: 

* Storms or stormy weather is an important feature in the Mediæval Icelandic saga-literature, in particular relating to sea-voyages. Narratives describing the settlement of Iceland, the landnám, feature stormy conditions troubling the settlers on their approach to Iceland (see Ogilvie & Gísli Pálsson; Barraclough 2012). Such perils have been discussed as collective memories (Hermann 2019).
* The mythological poetry but also later sögur have storms created and calmed by magic. Many names of mythical beings (especially so-called jötnar) relate to storms. 
* Many scientists believe that the number of cyclone storm systems in the North Atlantic will decline over the next 100 years (see Michaelis et al. 2017). This reduction in storminess, particularly in the winter months, will significantly alter precipitation patterns in the region, which could negatively affect human societies in coastal and inland areas.
