### Local Assembly 

###  Scope note: 
"Local assembly" refers to an organised administrative gathering that was held in a fixed location (at an asesembly site) at a fixed time (vorþing in the spring, haustþing/leiðarþing in the autumn). Local assemblies were established in the 10th century, before the establishment of the Alþingi, the national assembly. Legal cases were heard and administrative procedures implemented. The local assembly was also an important site for information exchange, trade/barter, and socialising.

### Examples: 

* Kjalnesingaþing, established by Þorsteinn Ingólfsson (son of Ingólfur Árnason) circa 900 C.E. (according to Ari froði Þorgilsson) 

* Þórsnesþing, established by Þórólfur Mostraskegg circa 932-34 (according to Eyrbyggja saga and Landnámabók)
