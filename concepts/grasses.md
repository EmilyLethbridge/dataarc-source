## Grasses 

###  Scope note: 
"Grasses" are plants of the Poaceae (formerly Gramineae) family, most commonly known as the short green vegetation in lawns and fields. Grasses are the staple foods for many grazing animals, but larger versions have been used as roofing material in the past, others producing edible seeds. Almost all grasses are wind pollinated and they are one of the most dominant plant types on the planet.

### Examples: 

* Grazing animals encourage the growth of grasses, which tolerate (and may be encouraged by) repeated cutting.
* Grasses are grown in fields to provide fodder for animals, in northern environments it has become common to package the harvest in covered bales as silage
