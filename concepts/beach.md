## Beach 

###  Scope note: 
"Beach" refers to the littoral zone where land and sea meet. These consist of accumulation of sediments along the shorelines of various bodies of water including lakes, seas, and oceans. Beaches can be divided into three categories according to the location and formation of sediment build-up: 1) sediments deposited along a rocky coast; 2) the extended border of marine of fluvial deposits; 3) narrow strips of sediments deposited in bars that run in parallel with extended coast or shorelines. Beaches comprise various ecological and geological features. Beaches play an important role in food gathering on and from the beaches as they figure important in sailing/nautical activities where they do not happen from harbors. In connection with beaches, boathouses are a common feature over the North Atlantic area for such nautical activities, beaches are used as shipyards and landing places. As landing places, beaches play a central role in economic activities, trade and exchange of goods, and these activities often come along with religio-cultural acts. Thus, beaches can function also as þing or assembly sites. In certain cases, traces of religious activities in the form of offerings and cult sites can be found.

### Examples: 

* Beaches have been researched as multi-functional areas. In particular, boathouses and their beach contexts have been subject to recent investigations with a particular focus on Norway but also considering evidence from other Scandinavian areas (Grimm 2006). Such boathouse sites, then, point to nautical, economical, and military activities, for instance, carried out on adjecting beaches. Also landing places have been recently collected in a helpful overview discussion by Bopel (2013).
* Depositions of precious objects, especially weaponry but also gold hoards, have been discussed more generally for wetlands (rivers, lakes, bogs) in inland contexts, but have also been associated with beaches (Lund 2008). Such deposits have been linked to the liminal dimension of beaches, rooted in larger cosmological conceptions in the pre-Christian religion(s) of the North. Similar attitudes to beaches as liminal zones can be found in early Modern folklore around the Northern Atlantic (e.g. Gunnell 2017).
* Dissipate beaches are characterized by gradually sloping sedimentation that runs from inland dunes to the surfzone beyond the shoreline.
