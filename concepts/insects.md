## Insects 

###  Scope note: 
Technically only six-legged arthropods, but the term is often casually used to include other arthropods such as spiders, mites and a number of ectoparasites. Insects are both pests (e.g. grain pests, eaters of fabric) and providers (e.g. pollinators, decomposers) and are found in almost all terrestrial and fresh-water environments. Many species are highly specific to environmental conditions, and they are used in palaeoecology to reconstruct past climates, environments and human activities.
