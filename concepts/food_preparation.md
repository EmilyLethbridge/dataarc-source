## Food Preparation

###  Scope note: 
"Food Preparation" denotes the final stages of processing of plant or animal products for storage or consumption. These activities including tertiary butchery, preserving with salt or smoke, and all forms of cooking. Evidence for preparation strategies includes study of fragmentation, cut marks, and burn marks on bones. Hearth and cooking area excavations, analysis of concentration of bone and fuel residues and plant phytoliths through soil micromorphology, analysis of vessel form and volume, residue analysis, and identification of cooking waste in midden deposits have all also produced evidence for past food preparation methods and food ways.  Documentary sources (in late medieval-modern contexts) such as cookbooks, menus, and butcher’s price lists have been used to interpret cooking and consumption patterns.

### Examples: 

* A large pit excavated at Hofstaðir containing ash and fire cracked stones and large amounts of animal bone was once interpreted as a cooking pit suggesting large scale food preparation connected to ritual feasting. The deposit since has been re-interpreted as the fill of a sunken feature structure that received multiple refuse streams ranging from primary butchery waste to fireplace and cooking residue dumps.
* Analysis of animal bones and artifacts from 19th century refuse deposits in the five points area of NYC aided by documentary sources have documented class and ethnic differences in food preparation and consumption.
* Analysis of lipid residue on prehistoric pottery has allowed identification of fish, dairy, and terrestrial mammal products in multiple archaeological contexts.
