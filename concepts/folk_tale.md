## Folk Tale 

###  Scope note: 
Short tales, composed anonymously and passed down orally until they were recorded in writing or as audio recordings from the 19th century onwards. Icelandic folktales as categorised by Jón Árnason (one of the main 19th-century collectors) cover: stories with a mystical or spiritual dimension; ghost stories; stories about magic and magicians; stories concerning natural history; stories concerning Christian miracles; stories about strange events (often giving rise to place-names); stories about outlaws; fairy-tales or pure fantasy tales; humorous stories; superstitions.  

### Examples: 

* How Hvalfjörður in western Iceland got its name
* The Ghostly Deacon of Myrká
* The Lagarfljótsormur (sea-monster of Lagarfljót, a lake in eastern Iceland)
