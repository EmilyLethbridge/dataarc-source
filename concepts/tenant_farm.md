## Tenant farm

###  Scope note:

“Tenant farms” refer to farms that are not owned by the resident family but are instead rented from a landowner. These landowners were often wealthy elites who were part of or had ties with estates, bishoprics, and royalty. In Iceland, tenant farms appeared after large early estates subdivided their own lands and created new subordinate tenant farms, likely populated by former laborers from their households. The rent for living at a tenant farm was usually paid for in work obligations or in kind where the tenant would provide their landlords with goods produced at their farm for example fish, hay, or wool. The rent paid was depending on the tenant farms location in the landscape and its distance to the landlords farm. The social structure and obligations of these tenant farms varies throughout the North Atlantic landscape.

### Examples:

* Tenant farms was the most common form of occupancy on Iceland during the 12th century up until the late 18th century. In 1695, almost 94% of all farms on Iceland were tenancies. These farms rarely paid their rent in minted coins but rather paid in kind as obligations for living at the farmstead. Tenant farms located around the wealthy bishopric Skáholt had to cut grass in Skáholts meadows, lend a horse to help bring goods to and from the market at Eyrarbakki, and help man its fishing vessels.
* Skagafjörður is an area on Iceland with many archaeological assemblages (1300-1900) that allow to study the relation between the elite landowners, farmers, tenants and the landless. Land tenure was negotiated regularly in Iceland with the average farm tenure in Skagafjörður being three years in the 19th century. The area saw two ecclesiastical estates owning most of the sites centered around Hólar and the cloister at Revnistaður. Tenant farms were found to become impoverished whereas the landowners consolidated their power.
* Seyla is an Icelandic farm which was owned by absentee landlords who rented to tenants.
* One of the tenant farmers in Banffshire (Highlands of Scotland), James Wilson, kept a diary recording his daily tasks and worries as a tenant farmer, including the farming work, drainage of the land, social and economic life of tenant farmers in 19th and 20th century Scotland.
