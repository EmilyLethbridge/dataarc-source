###  Scope note: 
"Herding" denotes the intentional and managed gathering of domestic or wild animals for purposes of movement of animal populations between areas. Herding practices may involve the selective movement of parts of an animal population. Herding activities may be communal or individual. Key sources of evidence include archaeologically preserved enclosures and documentary discussion. 

### Examples: 

* Herding related structures in Iceland may be termed "réttir". The construction of these structures at Hlidarétt (Iceland) suggests herd management practices which changed over time.

* The communally organized seasonal movement of sheep from summer pasture to winter grazing areas discussed in documentary sources implies herding.

* Specific age and sex profiles of animal populations near farm buildings, evidenced through zooarchaeological study, may suggest specific, selective, herding practices were in use.
