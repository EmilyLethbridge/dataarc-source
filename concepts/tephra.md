## Tephra 

###  Scope note: 
"Tephra" is any erupted material from a volcano, regardless of the size and shape of the material. Tephra therefore includes volcanic ash (particles <2mm in size), lapilli, which are particles of an intermediate size (2-64mm), such as coarser ash and gravel and finally larger material such as boulders >64mm. These volcanic eruptions can take place over short periods of time such as hours or days to longer eruptions that last for weeks. The shape of tephra particles also varies. Individual shards can be needle-like or more sub-angular or rounded, but not completely spherical. Tephra not only varies in size and shape but also in color, which is linked to the eruption type and volcanic system it comes from. Colors range from black to dark grey or brown, indicating a basaltic eruption, to white, which indicates there is a lot of the mineral silica within the tephra. 

Tephra deposits are found close to the volcanic source as well as hundreds of kilometers away, meaning locations that do not have active volcanoes (e.g. Scotland) can have traces of tephra. Larger tephra is generally found closer to the volcanic vent whereas tephra that is smaller and lighter can be deposited much further away. These deposits can be found in land, sea, and ice, providing key information on palaeoenvironmental, geological, archaeological and paleoclimatic events in the area. This can be studied through a variety of methods, some of which examine the chemical composition of the tephra, while others look at the individual glass shards and others at the sediments surrounding the deposit. In the North Atlantic, volcanic systems in Iceland and Canada are major producers of tephra.

An example of how tephra deposits are used is through tephrochronology. Tephrochronology was developed in Iceland by Sigurður Thórarinsson, who was the first to identify and use tephra layers in the soil stratigraphy as a chronological tool that can be used to date archaeological sites, environmental records, and events. Volcanic ash layers are identified, correlated, and then dated to establish a chronology, which can then be applied to a range of settings. 

### Examples: 

* Tephra found in Greenland ice cores could possibly help to identify and analyze climate change to certain tephra layers. By doing so it is possible to better understand and place certain climatic events in relation to other geographical areas where tephra exist.
* Cryptotephra is tephra particles that are so small they are invisible to the naked eye and require a microscope for identification. Deposits of cryptotephra can be found very far away from the volcanic vent that produced it as the tephra can be easily transported and retained in the atmosphere for weeks-months. Often there are only a few shards of cryptotephra found at any given site. These provide important insights into the eruptive history of a volcanoes as well as a dating tool, such as for archaeological sites
* Visible layers of tephra (mostly volcanic ash) can be found in the soil throughout Iceland. As Iceland has a volcanic eruption on average every 3-4 years, multiple tephra deposits dating back prior to human settlement and throughout the Holocene are found across the country, which are well separated due to Iceland’s high sediment accumulation rates. These tephra layers vary in thickness, color, particle size and come from a range of volcanoes.
