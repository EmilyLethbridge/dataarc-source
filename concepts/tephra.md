## Tephra 

###  Scope note: 
Tephra is any erupted material from a volcano, regardless of the size and shape of the material. Tephra therefore includes ash (particles <2mm in size), lapilli, which are particles of an intermediate size (2-64mm), such as coarser ash and gravel and finally larger material such as boulders >64mm. These volcanic eruptions can take place over short periods of time such as hours or days to longer eruptions that last for weeks or months. Tephra are often composed mainly of volcanic glass shards (magma that has cooled very quickly on being erupted), minerals (or even minerals and glass combined) and rock fragments from the volcanic edifice. The shape of tephra particles also varies. Individual shards can be sub-angular, rounded, elongated or even needle-like, but not completely spherical. Shards can be solid or may contain vesicles, resembling larger pieces of pumice. Tephra not only varies in size and shape but also in color, which is linked to the eruption type and volcanic system it comes from. Colors range from black to dark grey, brown or green, indicating a basaltic eruption, to white, which indicates there are higher quantities of silicon dioxide within the tephra.

Tephra deposits are found close to the volcanic source as well as hundreds of kilometers away, meaning locations that do not have active volcanoes (e.g. Scotland) can have traces of tephra. Larger tephra shards and thicker layers are generally found closer to the volcanic vent, whereas tephra that is smaller and lighter can be deposited much further away. These deposits can be found in land, sea, and ice, providing key information on palaeoenvironmental, geological, archaeological and paleoclimatic events in the area. Floating pumice can also be produced by either submarine eruptions or volcanoes close to the coast, which can then be distributed by ocean currents to distant shores. This can be studied through a variety of methods, some of which examine the chemical composition of the tephra, while others look at the individual glass shards and others at the sediments surrounding the deposit. In the North Atlantic region, vIceland is the main producer of tephra, with contributions from further afield such as Canada and Alaska.

An example of how tephra deposits are used is through tephrochronology. Tephrochronology was developed in Iceland by Sigurður Thórarinsson, who was the first to identify and use tephra layers in the soil stratigraphy as a chronological tool that can be used to date archaeological sites, environmental records, and events. Volcanic ash layers are identified, correlated, and then dated to establish a chronology, which can then be applied to a range of settings.

### Examples: 

* Visible layers of tephra can be found in the soil throughout Iceland. As Iceland has a volcanic eruption on average every 3-4 years, multiple tephra deposits dating back prior to human settlement and throughout the Holocene are found across the country, which are well separated due to Iceland’s high sediment accumulation rates. These tephra layers vary in thickness, color, particle size and come from a range of volcanoes. These not only provide chronological controls, but environmental conditions at the time of, and since, deposition can also be deduced the layers shape and characteristics.

* Cryptotephra are tephra particles that are so small they are invisible to the naked eye and require a microscope for identification. Deposits of cryptotephra can be found very far away from the volcanic vent that produced it as the tephra can be easily transported and retained in the atmosphere for weeks-months. Often there are only a few shards of cryptotephra found at any given site. These provide important insights into the eruptive history of a volcanoes as well as a dating tool in palaeoenvironmental and archaeological sites.

* Tephra found in Greenland ice cores aids in the identification of climate impacting volcanic eruption and the high precision of ice core dates leads to improved chronology of eruptions. Distinctive tephra layers have also been used to correlate ice cores and correct dating discrepancies.
