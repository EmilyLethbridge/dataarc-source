## Haunted Place 

###  Scope note: 
A haunted place is a site associated with supernatural or paranormal activity. The Sagas of Icelanders contain many examples of individuals who become revenants and haunt farms or valleys after death, often in a malevolent fashion, until they are put to rest. 

### Examples: 

* Þórólfur bægifótur from Hvammur, Helgafellssveit (on Snæfellsnes) in Eyrbyggja saga

* Glámur the shepherd at Forsæludalur (Vatnsdalur, northern Iceland) in Grettis saga
