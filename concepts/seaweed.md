## Seaweed 

###  Scope note: 
"Seaweed", a collection of marine algal types, is a marine vegetation type, most commonly observed by people when it is washed up on beaches. Seaweed has many forms, from massive kelp forests to small mobile varieties, and has numerous human uses. Kelp is an increasingly common food ingredient, and seaweed has been harvested in the North Atlantic region as fodder for animals and fertilizer for fields. It is sometimes found on archaeological sites, either carbonised or in waterlogged deposits.

### Examples: 

* Seaweed is an important seashore habitat for a variety of invertebrates which can tolerate saline environments. These species are in turn an important source of food for birds.
* Sheep eating seaweed has been observed in Iceland.
* Seaweed has a high phosphate content and, when burnt, may be introduced into nutrient poor fields to inprove their productivity. This was more common before the invention of artificial fertilizers in the 19th century.
* If seaweed is found in archaeological deposits radiocarbon dating should be undertaken with caution, as the reservoir effect of sea water may lead to dates which are too old.
