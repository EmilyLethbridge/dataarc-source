## Trees 

###  Scope note: 
"Trees" are large woody plants, destinguishable by their size and (with a couple of exceptions) hard stems. Trees provide important building material, fuel, and food throughout most of the world. They may be cultivated, and domestic variations of many species exist.

### Examples: 

* Trees produce more pollen per individual plant than any other species, and are thus over-represented in pollen diagrams. Regional pollen productivity estimates (PPE) are used to correct for this and convert pollen diagrams into something more closely represnting a landscape reconstruction.
* Trees may be considerd a general habitat type in themselves, as other ogranisms live in or on their wood, bark, leaves and roots as well as live in their shade or among their branches. 
* Forestry is the cultivation of trees as a resource.
