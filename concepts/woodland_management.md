## Woodland Management

###  Scope note: 
"Woodland Management" is the care, manipulation or administration of wooded environments towards a particular goal. In the past, most goals would have been for the benefit of people, such as encouraging particular species or habitats, but more recently conservation and environmental goals have emerged for preserving biodiversity, rare species, or the general preservation of woodlands.

### Examples: 

* Hazelnut trees may have been selectively encouraged in the mesolithic of Central-Northern Europe as a food source and construction (baskets, fish traps etc.) material. 

* Swedish forest are rarely allowed to grow for longer than 60 years, which is considered the optimal age for a return of investment in timber production.

* Clearings may be created in woodlands to encourage grazing animals to congregate, and make them easier to hunt.
