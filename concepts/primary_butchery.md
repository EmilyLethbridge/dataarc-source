
## Primary Butchery

###  Scope note: 
"Primary Butchery" denotes the slaughter and initial preparation of an animal carcass. Activities include killing, blood removal, skinning and removal of hides, and removal of internal organs. 

### Examples: 

* Primary butchery is evidenced by the pattern of cut marks on animal bones, including sheep and cattle bones. Varied primary butchery cut marks and consistent secondary butchery cut marks may indicate redistribution of meat. 

* Middens at Sveigakot, Selhagi, and Hofstaðir contain bones indicative of primary butchery, but also of tertiary butchery, directly associated with food preparation.
