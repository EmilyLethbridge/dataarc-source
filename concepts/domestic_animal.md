## Domestic Animals

###  ‘Domestic animals’ refer to animals that have been ‘domesticated’. This refers to a relationship between humans and animals in which a wild ancestor moves into a close relationship with humans and goes through morphological and behavioral changes that are the product of its domestication. These changes often entail neotony, the retention of immature physical characteristics into maturity, and a dampened fight or flight reflex, and decreased aggression overall. In a domestication relationship the primary sexual selection influence moves from natural variables to human controlled variables. The human and the domesticate become reliant on each other for the maintenance of their subsistence. Humans breed animals for specific characteristics, i.e. in sheep (ovis aries), wool production, increased milk production, and/or fat production.

This was a process whose earliest manifestation is seen in the domestication of wolves (canis lupus) into the domestic dog (canis familiaris). For the North Atlantic the suite of domesticated animals used is the same as the earliest middle eastern (fertile crescent) package, along with dogs and horses. Domestic animals were of the utmost importance to Norse and later European cultures in the sub-arctic and arctic due to the relative lack of the correct environmental conditions for the growing of domesticated plants.

###  Examples:

* Cattle (Bos Taurus) in the European North Atlantic context were generally a high status animal, meaning they were very valuable. They were primarily raised for milk production though they were at times raised soley for meet production, such as seen at the 17th and 18th century levels of the archaeological site of Skalholt.

* Sheep (Ovis aries) in the European North Atlantic context were often the domestic animal present in the largest numbers at farms. They were primarily raised for milk and wool, while they were eaten for meat when needed, or for culling the young and processing the old. 

* Horses (Equus caballus) in the European North Atlantic context were present in smaller numbers in the archaeological record but were of obvious importance throughout the pre-modern period for transportation. Evidence of their cultural importance in pre-christian times can be found in the fact that they are sometimes found buried with, presumebaly, their human owners (sometimes with a dog as well).
