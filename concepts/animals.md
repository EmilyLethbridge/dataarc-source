## Animals

###  Scope note: 
An “animal” is a multicellular member of the kingdom of Animalia. Animals are non-plant organisms. Animals have well-defined shapes and limited growth, which is accomplished through the expansion of body parts, rather than just at the edge as with plants and fungi. Animals are also able to move voluntarily because they possess muscles, but are constrained by this to more or less the same shape throughout life. Characteristics of animals (e.g., hair, feathers, and size) vary greatly across the world, as animals are shaped by their environments through the process of evolution. Animals must acquire living food and digest it. They possess both sensory and nervous systems. Animals represent ¾ or more of all species present on Earth and reflect almost every known mode of living. Animals have always been a central part of human-environmental interactions, both in the past and today. They have been used for millions of years by humans (and human ancestors) for many purposes, such as food, shelter, clothing, symbols, tools, laborers, instruments, and other material goods. 

### Examples: 

* Birds comprise more than 10,400 species and are unique to other animals in that they possess feathers, hollow bones and forelimbs modified for flight. They are warm-blooded vertebrates, who live on every continent.
* Frogs are tailless amphibians with smooth skin. They generally possess protruding eyes, and strong, webbed hind feet adapted for swimming. They are mainly aquatic, but some may live on land, in burrows, or on trees. 
* Whales are warm-blooded aquatic mammals that can grow to be up to 30m long and 200 metric tons. They are found in all of the world’s oceans and seas that are not landlocked. Whales are entirely adapted to aquatic environments and possess tails, flukes, and blowholes. 
* During the Mesolithic, marine animals were a main food source in Britain. However, people shifted away from a marine-based diet with the Neolithic Revolution. 
* Deer have been both hunted for food and had their bones and antlers used as tools, such as awls, in Northeastern North America.
