## Tithe

###  Scope note:

A tax levied by the church on farms in Iceland. Revenue from the tithe was divided into four parts among the bishop, the local priest, the parish church and the poor. The tithe was introduced to Iceland in 1097 when the Alþingi passed it into law, on the innovation of Bishop Gissur Isleifsson (1048-1118).
