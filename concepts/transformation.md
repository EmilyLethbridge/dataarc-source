### Transformation 

###  Scope note: 
The dataarc community investigates long-term human-environment dynamics. In this context, "transformation"  is a type of activity wherein the physical, material properties of an entity are altered, and the intended or actual use of the entity is also altered.

### Examples: 

* The conversion of milk into skyr through processing and ageing. 
* The reuse of structural elements of an earlier farm building in the construction of a later, larger hall.
* The change of a person into a monster, as described in a Saga story such as  Fáfnir from Völsunga saga, Ögmundr from Örvar-Odds saga, or Glámr from Grettis saga Ásmundarsonar.
