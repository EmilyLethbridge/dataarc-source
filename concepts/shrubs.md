## Shrubs 

###  Scope note: 
"Shrubs" are short, woody plants which form the vertical layer between herbs/grasses and trees. The term may be used synonymously with 'bushes'. Shrubs often have multiple stems, although in graden use short, single stemmed woody plants may be called shrubs. In Arctic conditions, shrubs generally establish on a landscape before trees, providing soil development and shelter for the latter to then develop.

### Examples: 

* In Monty Python's Quest for the Holy Grail, the Knights Who Say 'Ni'! demand that the adventurers obtain them a shrubary, or a collection of shrubs arranged into a graden feature.
* The dominant woody vegetation of Greenland would be considered by many as a shrub, never obtaining the height of a tree
* It is extemely difficult, if not impossible, to distinguish between shrubby and larger versions of the same tree species using fossil pollen. There are, however, indications that the size range of pollen grains may differ between variants of the plant, as is the case for birch.
