### Scope note

Dendrochronology denotes the dating of tree-growth rings, based on matching the growth rings in the sample to a master chronologoy. This approach can provide an absolute age for samples, depending on the availability of a suitable local master chronology. 

### Examples

* Dendrochronology can provide evidence of the date of construction of buildings e.g. by providing a felling year for the timbers used in construction

* It has also been used to date other wooden structures such as trackways
