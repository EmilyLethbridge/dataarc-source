## Tephrochronology

###  Scope note: 

'Tephrochronology' is a technique that used tephra (volcanic ash) layers to date and correlate sediments and archaeology. This technique allows isochronous marker horizons formed by tephra layers, to be mapped across local to inter-continental scale distances. These can create a dating framework against which other dating techniques can be checked and validated. Tephrochronology was pioneered by the Icelander Sigurður Thórarinsson, who not only developed the terminology, but also the principals which tephrochronologists still use. Tephrochronology can used to date rates of environmental change. 

### Examples: 

* Dating and linking archaeological and palaeoenvironmental stratigraphies

* The Landnám Tephra Layer is an isochrom that marks the beginning of the Norse settlement of Iceland

* Measuring rates of environmental change, such as Sediment Accumulation Raties (SeAR) - proxy for soil erosion
