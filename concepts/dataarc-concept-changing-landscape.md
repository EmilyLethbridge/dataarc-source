
## The Changing Landscape




###  Scope note: 
The dataarc community investigates long-term human-environment dynamics. "The changing landscape" is the overarching high-level concept which encompasses the project's research domain. 

### Examples: 

* The shift in settlement pattern in the Myvatyn region of Iceland from the 12th - 18th c. CE. 

* The use of tephrochronology to date accumulations of aeolian sediment  as a proxy for soil erosion and ecological indicators of landscape change across Iceland.

* The establishment of coastal fishing posts in the Hebrides and Orkneys in late pre-history.
