## Coastal Ocean 

###  Scope note: 
A "coastal ocean" is a part of the North Atlantic directly adjacent continental and insular landmasses. They are typically the sea-waters most familiar to human collectives. Coastal oceans are commonly frequented for fishing and other forms of food-gathering, they form important routes of transport and communication. At times, coastal waters become the oceanic battlefield of naval operations. In (pre-)historic periods these aspects were even more dominant and prevailing in comparison with high seas, when coastal oceans had a much more crucial role. Coastal oceans are particularly productive biomes. High abundances of microfauna including phytoplankton in North Atlantic coastal oceans support a great diversity of fish and mammal species, many of which have been targeted by human populations for food and other resources for millennia. Over time, overfishing has caused periodic declines in fish populations (Ames 2004; Rothschild et al. 1994). In addition, coastal ocean areas are also particularly sensitive to changing climatic and environmental conditions. In recent decades, anthropogenic factors including increased sedimentation runoff from rivers due to human landscape modification and deforestation as well as rising global temperatures from rising atmospheric greenhouse gases have led to major ecological collapses in many coastal ocean areas (Allison and Bassett 2015; Doney 2010; Syvitski et al. 2005; Walling 2006).
### Examples: 

* Decisive naval battles are fought consistently in coastal waters, like the Battle of Stiklestad in 1030, or that of Hafrsfjord sometime between 872 and 900. Countless minor skirmishes are also related in the saga-literature.
* Fishing was exclusively carried out in the coastal oceans by rowing boats, using primarily handlines. This custom continued in many parts of Scandinavia into the early modern era.
* The highly productive fishing grounds off the coast of New England were a major economic driver in the region for hundreds of years following European colonization (Ames). Overfishing in recent decades, however, has led to major declines in cod and haddock populations. These declines have had profound effects on the lives of coastal people who relied on the shallow coastal oceans of this region (Acheson and Gardner 2014).
