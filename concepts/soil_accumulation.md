## Soil Accumulation

###  Scope note: 

Variations in the rate of soil accumulation in Iceland are used as proxy for calculating soil erosion. The most common soils typed in Iceland are andosols, which are laregely derived from weathered tephra. This material is transported by wind across the landscape and accumulates as loessial soils. These soils are easily eroded by wind and water if the overlying vegetation cover is broken. Wind can then transport the silt-sized soil from the site of erosion to a nearby area where vegetation traps the soil particles incorporating new material into the soil profile and increasing its thickness. This means that soil erosion in one place can lead to increased soil accumulation in another. As many Icelandic soils contain well-dated tephra layers, we can caculated the rate that soil has accumulated between these often very precisely isochrons. This enables us to calculate and compare Sediment Accumulation Rates (SeAR) between sites (mm per year). Rapid increases in SeAR are assumed to be a result of enhanced nearby soil erosion. This underpins much of the research in Iceland on the environmental impact of the Norse settlement and subsequent human-environment interactions.

### Examples: 

* Establishing the environmental impact of the Norse settlement of Iceland, by comparing rates of soil erosion before and after the late 9th century deposition of the Landnám Tephra Layer.

* Investigate the impact of climate, disease and land management practices on rates of SeAR across a landscape through time.

* The assess the impact of the volcanic activity (deposition of tephra layers) on landscape stability.
