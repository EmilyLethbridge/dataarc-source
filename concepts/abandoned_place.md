## Abandoned Place 

###  Scope note: 
An abdoned place might be a farmstead or settlement that has been deserted at some point in time by its inhabitants. A farmstead might be abandoned if the land were no longer producutive, for example as a consequence of landscape destabilisation (erosion linked to human settlement, or natural disasters such as volcanic eruptions, glacial flooding etc). Other examples of abandoned places might be harbours that silt up and become unusable, or trading sites that are associated with harbours and that have to be abandoned or moved.   

### Examples: 

* Þjóðsárdalur in southern Iceland (farmsteads)
* Hrafnkelsdalur in eastern Iceland (farmsteads)
* Kúvíkur in northwest Iceland (trading site)
* Maríuhöfn in western Iceland (harbour and trading site)
