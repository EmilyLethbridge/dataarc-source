## Garden Plot 

###  Scope note: 
A “garden plot” can be defined as a managed, intensively-used outdoor space which is traditionally used for display, growing plants/crops, a social space, and as a way of enjoying nature and the landscape. Garden plots are usually found around or near residential dwellings or in settlement areas. They can also be communal in nature, such as a community garden or a shared garden. Garden plots can be enclosed if they are private, or open if they belong to a community or are in an impromptu cultivation space, such as a pasture or arable field. Garden plots include both wild and cultivated plants. Particularly in the North Atlantic, garden plots are used to grow vegetables and other food sources for both human and animal consumption and are a vital part of subsistence. These cultivated areas were used in the North Atlantic to grow vegetables and plants on a smaller scale than cultivation fields, which were often more structured, specialized and dedicated to one specific type of crop. During the early Neolithic in the North Atlantic, a ploughed field might have resembled a garden plot, which is called horticulture. The plants grown in garden plots often leave few archaeological remains and are therefore difficult to find. While they were used to cultivate essential vegetables and medicinal herbs, they were also social spaces in which people could engage with nature and with other members of the community. As Johnston (2007) states, “they provide[d] the conditions for identity to be expressed and maintained.” Gardens were also a sign of affluence and prestige, where their owners exhibited ornamental and work-intensive cultivation. In many castle and palace gardens during the medieval period, garden plots were used as decorative social spaces. These highly decorated spaces encouraged social interactions, including parties, strolls, and fun and games.

### Examples: 

* Garden plots are a common feature in the Bronze age landscape of Britain, often found next to houses and adjacent to field systems which provides insight into the cultivation, environmental knowledge, and land management priorities of the inhabitants. The presence of gardens in the archaeological records indicates that they have been a feature of the landscape for a long time. 
* House/Vegetable Gardens- similar to their use today, these included cultivation of vegetables, herbs, and ornamental plants
* Kitchen Gardens- as common today as in the past, these gardens are small plots of land located near a house used to grow vegetables, fruit, and berries as an additional source of food
* Community Gardens- social spaces in which members of the community could interact, express themselves and engage with the botanical world
* Monastic/Monastery Gardens- used to grow decorative plants, vegetables and fruits, and medicinal plants. These could then allow for spiritual development among the monks as well as a source of food and medicine. It is likely that, in Iceland, monastic gardens cultivated medicinal, utility, and ornamental plants; a practice that they continue to this day.
* Castle and Palace Gardens in Britain- formal, ornamental gardens which constituted a display of power and status, as they were work-intensive and often included exotic plants not native to the area
