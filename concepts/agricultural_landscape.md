## Agricultural Landscape 

###  Scope note: 
"Agricultural Landscape" denotes the entire area managed for the production of food crops, including areas for hay and fodder growth, pasture areas, processing structures, and inhabitation sites occupied by in situ farming communities.  

### Examples: 

* Sheiling areas and associated sheiling huts are part of the agricultural landscape across the North Atlantic.
* Enclosed field systems on the northern inland fringe in Iceland show the organization of an agricultural landscape.
* Clearance cairns in Scotland's Highlands and Islands are associated with agricultural land improvement efforts.
