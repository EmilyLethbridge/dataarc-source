## Managed Landscape Area 

###  Scope note: 
A “managed landscape area” is a regularly and actively maintained area of the landscape through human intervention as a way to preserve the purpose it was designed for. A managed landscape can be related to recreational, functional, or ritual activities. Most landscapes are managed in some way as is the case of forests, fields, parks, gardens, sport fields, urban environments, and ancient monuments. Even areas which appear to be natural, such as forests, are maintained, as is the case of most forests in Scandinavia. Closed forests in Europe were managed for timber production, with human intervention allowing scattered trees to grow but managing the growth of shrubs which could be a threat to the growth of trees. The management of these landscapes produces a landscape which is different to the way in which the area would have been if left in its natural, unmaintained state.

Landscape management is a practice that continues to this day, with intervention and management taking place as a way to preserve landscapes with an ecological and historical value. In Iceland, areas that were cleared of woodland when the Norse settlers arrived are now being re-forested and maintained. Similarly, areas of peatland in Scotland that were drained in the past are now being restored and rewilding as a result. Present day conservation efforts to maintain traditional farming landscapes or early modern industrial landscapes actively tries to prevent changes in the near surrounding areas to keep the “intended purpose” for future generations to experience.

### Examples: 

* Fields and general agricultural areas - the Infield-outfield system used by the Norse settlers in Iceland allowed them to be largely self-sufficient. They were an integral part of the production system. An important land management strategy that was implemented for livestock is that these were moved to the highlands during the summer while grass was grown to produce fodder to sustain the livestock over winter. 
The Viking settlers used an infield-outfield system. This allowed for a large part of the landscape to be utilized as animals were herded during the summer to the highland shieling system to graze whilst crops and fodder was grown at the main farm. Similar types of systems also developed in Scotland and Ireland during the Iron Age.
* Monuments, grave fields, and garden cemeteries - an example of these is the Glasgow Necropolis which went from a park to a fully maintained Victorian garden cemetery. Landscape management in the necropolis is necessary to ensure its standing as an “attractive and hygienic amenity”, allowing visitors to enjoy the space while maintaining the graves and mausoleums in good conditions. Most of the management that takes place in the garden cemetery is centered around the removal of shrubs and the maintenance of the plants.
* Wood-pastures and closed forests - these were maintained with regular grazing to avoid the growing of shrubs and fast-growing trees that could deplete the grassland.
