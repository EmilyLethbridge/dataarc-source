## Infield Area

###  Scope note:

An "infield area" is comprised of the improved land within the enclosure typically encircling an Icelandic medieval farmstead. This land was improved using household waste and manure. It was used for both grazing and for fodder production.

### Examples:

* The outfield/infield system is a ubiquitous division of land on medieval Icelandic farmsteads.
