## Livestock

###  Scope note: 
“Livestock” refers to a number of species of domesticated animals that are often introduced into new landscapes alongside the expansion of human settlement. While there are important exceptions, the majority of livestock species that have been most useful to humans are terrestrial mammals such as cow (Bos sp.), sheep (Ovis sp.), goat (Capra sp.), pig (Sus sp.), and horse (Equus sp.). These species have undergone morphological and behavioral changes due to selective breeding from a wild ancestor. These animals are kept in herds and require varying levels of husbandry commitments. Depending on the landscape, environment, and prevailing cultural norms, these include the need for grazing, fodder production, and sheltering as well as the culture and infrastructure required to extract secondary products (such as meat, milk, and wool) from the animals. Livestock can have impacts on both the human population as well as the landscape on which they are situated. These impacts can include the construction of livestock-related infrastructure on the landscape as well as erosion and potential landscape degradation.

### Examples: 

* Land degradation tied to grazing in shieling areas in Iceland.
* The importance of imported livestock in early survival in the North Atlantic.
