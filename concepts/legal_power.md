## Legal power

###  Scope note:
"Legal power" is power invested in agents by the rule of law. Iceland was an independent republic up until 1262/64 and did not have a monarch as head of state. From 930 C.E. when the Alþingi (national assembly) was established, an elected 'law-speaker' was effectively the head of state but there was no executive arm of government with the power to actively enforce the law. Suits were prosecuted by private individuals and judicial decrees were enforced privately. The law and legal power were therefore a fundamental part of the establishement of early Icelandic society but in a very different way to other European medieval societies. 


### Examples:
* Power of attorney.

* The power to mandate payment for an infraction.

* The power of an individual in Republic-Age Iceland to enforce a judicial ruling on a lawsuit.
