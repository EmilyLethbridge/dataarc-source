## Assembly site

###  Scope note:
An Icelandic "assembly site" (or "thing-site") is a location where communities gathered to vote on community or national issues. Assembly sites were equally important as places where information was exchanged and power was negotiated outside formal, legal and administrative proceedings.  

### Examples:
* The Þingvellir national assembly site (now a national park, for its history see here https://www.thingvellir.is/en/history-nature/history/)

* The Hegranes regional assembly site, Skagafjörður
