## Land Management 

###  Scope note: 
"Land Management" denotes the intentional, planned use of land resources, such as soil, water, and plants through practices including planting, drainage, fertilizing, and enclosing. Land management is the process of taking care of, maintaining, and planning the use of land as a resource for environmental and economic purposes. This can be managing agriculture, energy production, water, natural areas, and the plant and animal species that reside on the land. Land management is extremely important for protecting and preserving the variety of interconnected systems within it. Land management for environmental purposes could consist of land revitalization or sustainable acts such as reforestation. Land management for economic purposes could consist of organic agriculture, eco-tourism projects, or mineral extraction. Sustainable land management is a movement to use land resources in a manner that does not deplete them or harm the environment but protects the long-term use of resources. Sustainable land management in the contemporary context seeks to protect the environment while also providing economically viable options for those using the land. 


### Examples: 

* Seaweed was used as a fertilizer in Orkney to support the growth of barley as a crop, and its use is reflected in stable isotope ratios in animal bones. 

* Wet Meadows were managed for the production of hay for fodder in enclosed homefield areas in Norse Iceland. Their management is researched through palynology and thin section micromorphology. 

* The Norse had land management strategies for sustainability with grazing animals, such as described in the Old Icelandic law Code, Grágás (replaced in the AD 1280s), which was used to control the levels of livestock so that the landscape was not over exploited (Dugmore et al. 2007). Additionally, in the Faroe Islands, the people managed rangeland through pasture units. By around twelfth century AD, farmers were heavily using manuring to reach higher yields for their crops (Dugmore et al. 2007). Archaeological research in Greenland shows evidence of water-management strategies, such as controlling snow melt. Home-field management strategies were also used to support fodder production through colder temperatures and drought conditions.
* Sustainable agricultural land management practices have the potential to decrease the amount of greenhouse gas emissions by altering tilling practices. These practices also reduce soil erosion and improve soil quality.
