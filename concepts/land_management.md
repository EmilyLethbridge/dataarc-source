## Land Management 

###  Scope note: 
"Land Management" denotes the intentional, planned use of land resources, such as soil, water, and plants through practices including planting, drainage, fertilizing, and enclosing. 

### Examples: 

* Seaweed was used as a fertilizer in Orkney to support the growth of barley as a crop, and its use is reflected in stable isotope ratios in animal bones. 

* Wet Meadows were managed for the production of hay for fodder in enclosed homefield areas in Norse Iceland. Their management is researched through palynology and thin section micromorphology.
