## Saga Narrative 

###  Scope note: 
A saga narrative is a prose (or mixed prose and poetry) written composition from medieval Iceland. There are several genres or categories of sagas but the most famous are the Sagas of Icelanders (Íslendingasögur). Many of these were composed in the 13th century and they describe the settlement of Iceland (in the late 9th century) and the lives of the generations descended from the original settlers. Other saga genres include the kings' sagas (konungasögur), bishops' sagas (biskupasögur), contemporary sagas (samtíðarsögur), mythical-heroic sagas (fornaldarsögur) and chivalric sagas (riddarasögur).   

### Examples: 

* Reykdæla saga, set in the north of Iceland in the Mývatn area
* Njáls saga, set in the south of Iceland
* Hrafnkels saga, set in the east of Iceland
