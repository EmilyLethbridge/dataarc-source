## Beached Whale

###  Scope note:
"Beached Whale" denotes the presence of a live or dead whale (as distinct from a beached dolphin or porpoise), stranded on a shoreline either intentionally or naturally. This can be the consequence of many things, i.e. dead whales washing up on beaches due to currents and wave action, or sick or disoriented whales washing up on beaches due to storms and other variables and then dying. Cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoise) may beach alone or as part of a pod, and such strandings may occur year-round. In the premodern European North Atlantic a beached whale can generally be seen as a asset for whatever group was able to claim ownership over the carcass. Beached whales represent an unquantifiable and often unpredictable economic resource that were foraged according to established laws across the medieval world. In Iceland for example, different groups had the rights to beached whales by legal right. The term 'hvalreki' in Icelandic refers both to a beached whale but also to a stroke of luck. Whales supplied meat, fat, oil, bone and if from the right type of whale baleen. Whales appear both in coastal as well as inland archaeological sites in the North Atlantic. Key sources of evidence for beached whales include historical, literary, and legal texts. Whale bones are present within the archaeological record, but the means of acquisition (hunted versus stranded whales) cannot be distinguished material evidence.

### Examples:

* The presence of large whale vertebrae used as a butcher's block in an 18th century archaeological context (Skalholt; Hambrecht 2011).

* The presence of large amounts of fragmented and burnt whale bone presumeably being used as fuel at a 17th century archaeological context (Grof; Hambrecht and Gibbons 2018)

* Whale bone present, and presumeably the refuse from butchering, at medieval coastal fishing sites in Northest Iceland (Akurvik and Gjogur; Edvardsson et al 2004)

* The use of beached cetaceans was depicted as common during periods of landnám or travel in Icelandic sagas, i.e., Egil’s saga (ch.29); Eirik’s saga (ch.8); Grettir’s saga (chs.12,25), Laxdaela saga (ch.2).

* Laws dictating the process for division of beached whales were explicit from the earliest Norwegian recorded laws and become detailed in later medieval Icelandic law, especially the Grágás.

* Specific portions of beached cetaceans were shared among farms within a hreppur, particularly by church officials, as seen throughout the Diplomatarium Islandicum
