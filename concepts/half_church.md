## Half church

###  Scope note:

A church that holds services amounting to half the liturgical calendar. A priest could be assigned to such a church in addition to his or her main parish. Iceland was converted to (Catholic) Christianity in 1000 C.E.. Originally there does not seem to have been a distinction between half churches (hálfkirkja) and full churches (alkirkja) but by the 14th century, churches were divided into three categories: alkirkja (full church), hálfkirkja (half church) and bænhús (prayer house). There was a requirement to hold mass in a full church on every holy day but only every other holy day in a half church. To begin with, half churches were established as satellites of full churches, and the priest from the local parish church held religious services in them. Many half churches did not have cemetaries.    

### Examples:

* Half churches were common on pre-modern Icelandic farms.
