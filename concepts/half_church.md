## Half church

###  Scope note:

A church that held services amounting to half the liturgical calendar and that did not have a resident priest. Iceland was converted to (Catholic) Christianity in 1000 C.E. In a half church (hálfkirkja), there was a requirement to hold mass every other holy day (as opposed to every holy day in whole churches). Half churches did not always have a consecrated cemetery. The status of individual churches is recorded in documents such as diplomas (fornbréf), and also in Árni Magnússon's and Páll Viðalín's Jarðabók from the early 18th century. See also "whole church".
