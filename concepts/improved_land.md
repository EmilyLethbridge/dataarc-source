## Improved Land

###  Scope note:
“Improved land” refers to agricultural land that has been altered by human labor in an effort to maintain or improve yields. In the North Atlantic, initial land clearance in which brushy native trees were replaced by open pastureland was a widespread result of farming settlement. Fencing and creation of separate infield and outfield areas, creation of trackways, bridges, and agricultural buildings all represent “improvement” and the accumulation of “Landesque capital”. Geoarchaeology has flagged multiple examples of the systematic application of soil amendments to infield areas (manure, seaweed, turf, midden materials) across the North Atlantic. Water control structures have been identified in both Iceland and Norse Greenland, both creating wet meadows and draining marshes.

### Examples:

* Deep (up to 1 m) deposits of anthropogenic “Plaggen” soil around Faroese villages creating favorable barley growing fields accumulated over multiple generations of effort.

* Water management structures (dams, ditches) are associated with medieval farms in both Iceland and Greenland aimed at preserving and enhancing highly productive wet meadows and extending the grazing season.

* The enrichment of homefield areas (often within a home field dyke) with soil amendments and fertilizer from multiple sources.

* Creation of dykes and walls to control stock movement and demarcate boundary areas in Iceland.
