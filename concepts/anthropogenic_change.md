## Human Induced/Anthropogenic Change 

###  Scope note: 
"Anthropogenic, or human-induced, changes" are modifications to the landscape, environment, or ecological system that are caused or produced by humans and can be local or global in scale. Changes can be intentional (e.g., introducing a species into the environment) or unintentional (e.g., deforestation or increase in greenhouse gases). Anthropogenic change is currently considered one of the most significant environmental challenges that the world is facing, which often goes unrecognized or is poorly understood. These changes are also typically associated with industrialization and urbanization in a contemporary context. Anthropogenic change has been having a significant impact on the landscape since the Neolithic.

### Examples: 

* Global warming and climate change, resulting from increased carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, is an example of anthropogenic change that has taken decades to manifest and make apparent. An increase in the temperature of the Earth has implications for anthropogenic change in numerous Earth systems.
* In Iceland, humans had a major impact on the landscape, which began with Viking settlements in the ninth century AD (McGovern et al. 2007). Iceland has been severely deforested and suffers from soil erosion in many regions. Further, the introduction of agriculture to Iceland, including domesticated animals and crops, brought insects and wild plants from Europe, which rapidly changed the environment and landscape. Grazing animals put pressure on the landscape. However, some have argued that the Norse were successful in grazing management, which maintained and enriched vegetation and livestock productivity (Thomson et al. 2005).
