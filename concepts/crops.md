## Crops 

###  Scope note: 
"Crops" are cultivated plants which provide a food or material source for humans or their animals. Most crops are cultivated in concentrated areas at different scales, such as fields, plantations or gardens. The predominant crops found in archaeological deposits has changed over space and time, with different crops emerging as they are domesticated, or others being replaced depending on changed climatic or social conditions. 

### Examples: 

* Barley is grown to provide grains, flour and more importantly, beer.
* Flax is grown as a source of seeds, oil and rope (but there are differences between the plants for these purposes that may be visible in the archaeological record).
* Norse Greenland most likely had to import all of its barley as did not have a climate in which the crop could grow.
