<dc:title>Northwest Icelandic Cairns</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Mar Roige Oliver</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The Cairn Dataset identifies and maps possible navigational cairns in the Westfjords of Iceland. A cairn is a pile of rocks set up as a marker, monument, or memorial typical in the North Atlantic. This dataset gathers all possible cairn features identified from monochromatic aerial imagery (Imagery dates: 2017 and 2018). Only the cairns that are between one and three meters in width were mapped as it was assumed that bigger cairns are not marking the road but serving as markers for bigger structures such as medival assembly points. To avoid and reduce the incorrect marking of non-cairn features, all mapped cairns were given a number from one to five depending on their likelihood of them being a cairn with one being the least likely and five the most.</dc:description>
