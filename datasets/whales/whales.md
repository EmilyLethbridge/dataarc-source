# Whales dataset
**Creator:** Vicki Szabo

**Description:** This dataset includes some artifacts sampled as part of a larger NSF project #1503714, "Assessing the Distribution and Variability of Marine Mammals through Archaeology, Ancient DNA, and History in the North Atlantic." The NSF project has sampled whale bone from archaeological contexts from Orkney, Iceland, the Faroes, Greenland, and Newfoundland. Objects from several sites in Bronze Age, Iron Age, and Viking Age Orkney, included in the present data set, were sampled for both genetic and molecular identification. The larger project also includes historical, ethnographic, literary, and biological data in reconstructing whale use and whale populations across the premodern North Atlantic.

**Abstract:** The Whales Project data includes artifacts sampled from Bronze Age through Viking Age Orkney. The data set includes artifact descriptions, bone descriptions, and aDNA (ancient DNA) and ZooMS (Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry) data.
